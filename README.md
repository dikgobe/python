# python
on the next comming $ week we will be learning about python and the basics.Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s.The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released. This version included many features that remain in Python today, such as exception handling, functions, and modules. Python continues to progress with regular releases. Python 3.10, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, was one of the latest versions..the first thing we learned was Installing Anaconda on Windows which is a straightforward process. Anaconda is a popular Python distribution that includes Python, essential libraries, and tools for data science and scientific computing.We also learned about the Interactive mode in Python  wichis a way of using the Python interpreter to directly execute Python commands and get immediate results. It's an excellent way to test small code snippets, explore Python's features, and experiment with different functions or modules.
