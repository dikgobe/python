# python

Week 1
on the next comming $ week we will be learning about python and the basics.Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s.The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released. This version included many features that remain in Python today, such as exception handling, functions, and modules. Python continues to progress with regular releases. Python 3.10, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, was one of the latest versions..the first thing we learned was Installing Anaconda on Windows which is a straightforward process. Anaconda is a popular Python distribution that includes Python, essential libraries, and tools for data science and scientific computing.We also learned about the Interactive mode in Python  wichis a way of using the Python interpreter to directly execute Python commands and get immediate results. It's an excellent way to test small code snippets, explore Python's features, and experiment with different functions or modules.

 In Python, variables are used to store and manage data. They act as containers to hold values or objects. Variables are a fundamental concept in programming, and they play a crucial role in Python.Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore.Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are considered different variables.Avoid using Python reserved keywords (e.g., if, else, while, etc.) as variable names. variable casting, also known as type conversion, allows you to change the data type of a variable. This is useful when you want to perform operations that require operands of the same type or when you want to present data in a specific format. Python provides several functions to perform type casting. In Python, data types are used to classify and represent various types of data. Python is dynamically typed, which means that you don't need to declare the data type of a variable when you define it.Python also allows you to create custom data types through classes. This is a fundamental feature of Python's object-oriented programming paradigm. integers are a fundamental data type used to represent whole numbers. They can be either positive or negative. Integers are typically denoted using the int data typeA lambda expression in Python is a small anonymous (unnamed) function defined using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression. They are typically used when you need a simple, short function for a short period, and you don't want to give it a formal name using the def keyword.

 week 2

 Operators play a crucial role in writing code, allowing you to perform a wide range of tasks, from basic arithmetic calculations to complex logical and bitwise operations. Understanding how and when to use operators is essential for programming in Python or any other language. In programming, operators are symbols that perform operations on values or variables. Operators are a fundamental part of any programming language and are used to manipulate data, make decisions, and perform various computations. Python, like many other programming languages, provides a variety of operators to work with different data types and perform different tasks. Python supports various types of operators for performing operations on variables and values.In programming, operators are symbols that perform operations on values or variables. Operators are a fundamental part of any programming language and are used to manipulate data, make decisions, and perform various computations. Python, like many other programming languages, provides a variety of operators to work with different data types and perform different tasks. The random module in Python is a built-in module that provides various functions for generating random numbers and performing random operations. A recursive function in Python is a function that calls itself to solve a problem. This is a common and powerful technique in programming that allows you to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

Regular expressions, often referred to as regex or regexp, are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation in programming. They provide a concise and flexible way to search, match, and manipulate strings based on specific patterns .Reading and writing files in Python is a fundamental operation for working with external data, such as text 
 files.The following code reads data from a BankData.txt file and copy it into myoutput.txt file 

 week 3

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task or group of tasks. You define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses.lists are a versatile and commonly used data structure that allows you to store and manipulate collections of items.some of the essential operations and methods for working with Python lists. Lists are versatile and widely used in Python for a wide range of applications.you can implement both stacks and queues, which are fundamental data structures for managing collections of items using lists.List comprehensions are a concise and powerful way to create lists in Python. They provide a more readable and expressive way to generate lists by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) and optionally filtering the results. List comprehensions are more compact and elegant compared to traditional for loops when creating new lists.Nested list comprehensions allow you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each element of one or more input lists, creating a compact and readable way to work with multi-dimensional data.The del statement in Python is used to remove items or elements from a data structure, such as a list or a dictionary. It can also be used to delete variables.Sequences in Python refer to data structures that support sequential access to elements. Lists, tuples, and strings are common sequence types in Python. You can iterate over elements in a sequence using loops like for loops.a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are similar to lists and tuples, but they don't allow duplicate values. They are defined using curly braces {} or by using the set() constructor.You can also loop through the values of a dictionary using the .values() method:The comparison operators in and not in check whether a value occurs (does not occur) in a sequence. The operators is and is not compare whether two objects are really the same object; this only matters for mutable objects like lists. All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all numerical operators.
